| *All division files can be downloaded* `here <https://miami.box.com/s/lvrhgswninw59piawtwhi3lfs14rvx72>__`. I've simply added data for the main divisions here to save a bit of space on my Repo.
|
| The files without any extensions are `pandas.DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`__'s and can be opened with ``pd.read_pickle(file)``. 
| .csv files are Comma-separated values and can be opened with Microsoft Excel® or better yet `jupyter lab <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab>`__.
|
| ``*_raw`` files are the data downloaded from the CrossFit® site without any post-processing.
| Files that don't end in ``_raw`` have been post-processed using this (INSERT LINK HERE) methodology and are fit for statistical analysis and visualization.
|
| *If you publish anything with this data please let me know and if you like, I will add a link to your work here.*
| 
| *I have yet to add any statistical analyses and visualizations in this package. If you develop any python to code to analyse/plot this data and are happy to share it with me, I will incoroprate it into the package and acknowledge you.*
|
| *If you're not sure where to begin with plotting see my `TODO list <https://github.com/raybellwaves/cfanalytics/blob/master/TODO.rst#analysisplotting>`__.
