| The files without any extensions are `pandas.DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`__'s and can be opened with ``pd.read_pickle(file)``. 
| .csv files are Comma-separated values and can be opened with Microsoft Excel® or better yet `jupyter lab <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab>`__.
|
| ``*_raw`` files are the data downloaded from the CrossFit® site without any post-processing.
| Files that don't end in ``_raw`` have been post-processed using this methodology (TO DO: hyperlink to example) and are fit for statistical analysis and visualization.
